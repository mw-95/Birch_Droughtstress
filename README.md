# Birch_Droughtstress

Various GEE scripts that: 

- create a NDVI timeseries from Sentinel-2 data at selected plots
- create a NDVI timeseries from Landsat-8 data at selected plots
- create a VV/VH Backscatter timeseries from Sentinel-1 GRD data

to monitor drought stress in birch stands for selected plots in Germany using remote sensing data. 

The scripts were written by me for the Remote Sensing for Biodiversity course in the EAGLE M.Sc. at Uni WÃ¼rzburg.
